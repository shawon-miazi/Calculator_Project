ðŸ”¹ 1. Project Overview
This project is a basic command-line calculator developed in the C programming language. It supports simple arithmetic operations and maintains a history of calculations using file storage.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Objective
The purpose of this project is to:

Perform basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction.

Keep a record of past calculations (History).

Practice file handling and user interaction in C.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Features
Perform:

Addition

Subtraction

Show calculation history.

Exit option.

Simple and user-friendly menu.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Tools and Language
Programming Language: C

File Used: history.txt to save calculation logs

Compiler: GCC or any standard C compiler

ðŸ”¹ 5. Working Principle
The program runs in a loop, offering a menu to the user.

User selects an operation and enters two numbers.

The result is displayed and saved in a file along with timestamp.

When "History" is selected, previous results are shown by reading from the file.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Challenges Faced
Managing file read/write correctly.

Ensuring proper format and handling of time/date.

Validating user input to prevent unexpected behavior.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Conclusion
This project provided a hands-on understanding of:

File operations (fopen, fprintf, fgets)

Conditional logic and looping structures.

Menu-driven programs in C.

ðŸ”¹ 8. Future Improvements
Add more operations: Multiplication, Division, Power, etc.

Implement a clear history option.

Add input validation and error handling.

Create a GUI version using C++ or other frameworks.
